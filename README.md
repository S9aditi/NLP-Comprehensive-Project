# Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It integrates classical and modern approaches to solve various NLP tasks, with a structured flow that transitions seamlessly between steps. The pipeline emphasizes the practical application of techniques, providing solutions to real-world problems in NLP.

# Features
 1. Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization.
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into text data distribution, word frequency analysis, and visualization.
 3. Vectorization: Implementation of TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, and Word2Vec.
 4. Modeling: Classical machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) and modern deep learning architectures (LSTM, Transformers).
 5. Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis.
 6. Visualization: Charts and graphs to interpret results and feature contributions.
